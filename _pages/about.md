I am a third year PhD Student (5 year PhD program) at Technical University Delft, where I'm part of the [Interactive Intelligent Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/interactive-intelligence) at the Intelligent Systems Department of Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science. My PhD is part of [Delft AI Labs](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/tu-delft-ai-labs) and I belong to the [HIPPO Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/hippo-lab/), which aims to build AI-based decision support for addresing complex real-world problems such as climate change mitigation and adaptation.

My background and experience
======
 I obtained MSc in Computer Science and Econometrics from the University of Warsaw (Poland) in 2020. Between my MSc studies and the current position at TU Delft, I worked at the European Space Agency (ESA) for 1.5 years as a Data Scientist Young Graduate Trainee (YGT) in the domain of socio-economic data in Oxford, United Kingdom.



Research
======

Climate change and other societal challenges demand decisions that balance multiple, often conflicting objectives across complex and uncertain environments. My research focuses on developing applied reinforcement learning methods to support such complex decision-making processes, particularly in domains like climate adaptation and sustainable resource management.

At the HIPPO Lab, we aim to build trustworthy, interpretable, and just AI-based decision-support systems for public policy design. These systems assist decision-makers in exploring the trade-offs inherent in policies for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

My PhD research focuses on Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) ‚Äî a largely theoretical framework that enables learning across multiple, often conflicting objectives simultaneously. While MORL has significant potential for addressing complex real-world problems involving competing goals and uncertain environments, its application beyond simulation-based settings remains limited.

To bridge this gap, my work aims to make MORL applicable, interpretable, and explainable for decision-making in real-world contexts. I introduce practical, real-world problems where MORL can offer value, and develop methods and tools that help policymakers explore and understand the resulting trade-offs among learned policies. By combining algorithmic innovation with human-centered design, my research advances the use of reinforcement learning for complex, multi-objective decision-making, ensuring it becomes both usable and trustworthy for real-world applications.
