I am a first year PhD Student at Technical University Delft, where I'm part of the [Interactive Intelligent Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/interactive-intelligence) at the Intelligent Systems Department of Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science. My PhD is part of [Delft AI Labs](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/tu-delft-ai-labs) and I belong to the [HIPPO Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/hippo-lab/), which aims to build AI-based decision support for addresing complex real-world problems such as climate change mitigation and adaptation.

My background and experience
======
 I obtained MSc in Computer Science and Econometrics from the University of Warsaw (Poland) in 2020. Between my MSc studies and the current position at TU Delft, I worked at the European Space Agency (ESA) for 1.5 years as a Young Graduate Trainee (YGT) in the domain of socio-economic data science in Oxford, United Kingdom.



PhD Project
======


Climate change is a pressing global issue that affects all of us on a daily basis. The good news is that with the growing possibilities and development of AI, its potential can be harnessed for society to adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change. AI has already been used in IPCC reports, providing policy makers with direction on where to go and what climate policies would be most beneficial in fighting climate change. Our lab, the HIPPO Lab, aims to build trustworthy, just, and interpretable AI-based decision-support for decision makers in the field of public policy design, specifically in the areas of climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. Given the complexity of these issues and the need for multiple stakeholders and characteristics to be considered, we model them as multi-objective optimization problems and use specific algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning algorithms, to optimize for many conflicting objectives. Unfortunately, these algorithms output a set of optimal solutions, each of which offers trade-offs between conflicting objectives. These solutions are often hard to interpret and trust by decision makers, especially when the decision could affect society. My PhD project aims to build decision-support methods and tools that enable easy exploration of trade-offs by decision makers, making them trust and understand the outputs of AI, as well as building the condifence in designing policies based on these outputs.
