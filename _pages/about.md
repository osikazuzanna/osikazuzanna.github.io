I am a first year PhD Student at Technical University Delft, where I'm part of the [Interactive Intelligent Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/interactive-intelligence) at the Intelligent Systems Department of Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science. My PhD is part of [Delft AI Labs](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/tu-delft-ai-labs) and I belong to the [HIPPO Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/hippo-lab/), which aims to build AI-based decision support for addresing complex real-world problems such as climate change mitigation and adaptation.

My background and experience
======
 I obtained MSc in Computer Science and Econometrics from the University of Warsaw (Poland) in 2020. Between my MSc studies and the current position at TU Delft, I worked at the European Space Agency (ESA) for 1.5 years as a Young Graduate Trainee (YGT) in the domain of socio-economic data science in Oxford, United Kingdom.



PhD Project
======


Climate change is a pressing global issue that affects all of us on a daily basis. With the vast development of Artificial Intelligence, its  potential can be harnessed to help the society adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change. The HIPPO Lab aims to build trustworthy, just, and interpretable AI-based decision-support for decision makers in the domain of public policy design, specifically in the areas of climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. Since the world is complex and the issues we deal with usually include multiple stakeholders with conflicting objectives, we use multi-objective optimisation algorithms (such as evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning) to model the problems. In contract to single-objective algorithms (majority of ML models), allowing algorithms to optimise for multiple objectives can represent the complexities of the real-world problems better and produce more robust and unbiased solutions. Unfortunately, these algorithms output a set of optimal solutions, each of which offers trade-offs between conflicting objectives. These trade-offs are often hard to interpret and trust by the stakeholders/decision makers, especially when the decisions may affects the wide society. My PhD project aims to build decision-support methods and tools that enable easy exploration of the outputs of multi-objective optimisation algorithms by decision makers, making the human-AI interaction successful. Additionally, these tools would allow to build confidence in designing public policies based on AI recommendations.
