### Profile

Reinforcement Learning - Multi-Objective Decision-Making - Human-AI Interactions - Water Resource Management - Public Policy Design - Climate Change Adaptation - Data Science

## Profile

I am a third-year PhD student at TU Delft, working on enabling real-world application of multi-objective reinforcement learning. Specifically, I focus on real-world problems from the area of managing water resources with the use of AI, with multiple actors and objectives. Within my PhD, I work in the intersection of computer science, policy analysis, and civil engineering. <br>
