We present a review that unifes decision-support
methods for exploring the solutions produced by
multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithms.
As MOO is applied to solve diverse problems, approaches for analyzing the trade-offs offered by
MOO algorithms are scattered across felds. We
provide an overview of the advances on this topic,
including methods for visualization, mining the solution set, and uncertainty exploration as well as
emerging research directions, including interactivity, explainability, and ethics. We synthesize these
methods drawing from different felds of research
to build a unifed approach, independent of the application. Our goals are to reduce the entry barrier
for researchers and practitioners on using MOO algorithms and to provide novel research directions.
