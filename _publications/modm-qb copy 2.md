Multi-objective decision-making (MODM) involves AI (multi-objective optimization) algorithms that produce a set of solutions, and human
decision makers analyzing the trade-offs among the
algorithmic solutions to produce a final solution.
While MODM offers users greater freedom to interact with AI outputs and make decisions, it also
presents challenges in understanding both the outputs and the process by which they were generated.
To better understand the users’ needs for explainability in MODM, we conduct pilot interviews with
researchers who interacted with MODM to identify potential questions the users may ask about
MODM problems, process, and outputs. Based
on the intuitions from the pilot interviews, we develop the initial version of the explainable MODM
(XMODM) question bank. That is, we identify
questions for which explanations are potential answers. The XMODM question bank can be valuable resource for both practitioners, e.g., to assist
them in formulating questions about MODM, and
researchers, e.g., to assist them in understanding
what explanations are necessary.
