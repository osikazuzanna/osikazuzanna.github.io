In this project I aim to test how my tools (e.g. bi-objective clustering) helps the decision-makers to explore the outputs of MORL algorithms. More specifically, I will focus on decision-making in climate-related problems


This is work will be conducted after 2025 as it requires inputs from earlier projects.
