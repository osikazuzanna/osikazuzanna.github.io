title: "Interactive Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning"
excerpt: "This project aims to develop interactive MORL approaches, where the training process is more efficient as it takes into account user's preferences over time."

In this project I aim to test how my tools (e.g. bi-objective clustering) helps the decision-makers to explore the outputs of MORL algorithms. More specifically, I will focus on decision-making in climate-related problems


This is work requires background on RL and interactive multi-objective optimization.
