title: "Unification and modularization of water management systems simulations for direct application with Reinforcement Learning"
excerpt: "The goal of this project is to create a suite of water mamagement-related Mo-GYM environments for training reinforcement learning agents with multipe objectives. These environments simulate problems related to water management. Currently, the number of environments for MORL available is limited and represents mostly toy-examples. With the suite of water management-related environments, it will be possible to test different MORL algorithms on real-world examples with high impact."

The goal of this project is to create a suite of climate-related GYM environments for training reinforcement learning agents with multipe objectives. These environments simulate problems realted water management and CO2 emissions. Currently, the number of environments for MORL available is limited and represents mostly toy-examples. With the suite of climate-related environments, it will be possible to test different MORL algorithms on real-world examples with high impact.

This is work in progress, expected publication: 2025.
