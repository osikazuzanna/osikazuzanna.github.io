title: "Unification and modularization of water management systems simulations for direct application with Reinforcement Learning"
excerpt: "The goal of this project is to create a suite of water mamagement-related Mo-GYM environments for training reinforcement learning agents with multipe objectives. These environments simulate problems related to managing reservoirs around the world. Currently, the number of environments for MORL available is limited and represents mostly toy-examples. With the suite of water management-related environments, it will be possible to test different MORL algorithms on real-world examples with high impact. The modular framework will also allow researchers from water management to build their simulations in an easier, unified manner"

he goal of this project is to create a suite of water mamagement-related Mo-GYM environments for training reinforcement learning agents with multipe objectives. These environments simulate problems related to managing reservoirs around the world. Currently, the number of environments for MORL available is limited and represents mostly toy-examples. With the suite of water management-related environments, it will be possible to test different MORL algorithms on real-world examples with high impact. The modular framework will also allow researchers from water management to build their simulations in an easier, unified manner.

This work required knowledge of water systems and reinforcement learning and was done 100% in Python.

This is work in progress, expected publication: 2025.
