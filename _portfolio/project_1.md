This was done by reviewing currently exisitng methods to support the decision makers in this field, as well as conducting interviews with the decision makers to understand their needs.

In this project, I aim to understand human's needs for explainability within multi-objective decision making. This was done by reviewing currently exisitng methods to support the decision makers in this field, as well as preliminary interviews with the decision makers to understand their needs. Next step is to conduct more interviews with more diverse decision-makers and create a resource with different needs

This work resulted in publication of two papers (literature review and working paper). Currently working on conducting more interviews to create a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.
